# Data Insights: COVID-19 and NYPD Shooting Data

This repository contains R-based data analysis projects for public datasets, created as part of a Master's project. The analyses focus on two primary datasets:
- COVID-19 pandemic data
- NYPD historical shooting incidents

Each analysis uses R Markdown to explore, visualize, and derive insights from the data.

## Files Included:
1. **COVID-19 Data Analysis** ([HTML Report](./week5-covid19-3.html))
   - This report explores various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic using publicly available data. It provides insights into infection rates, mortality, and other key metrics.
   
2. **NYPD Shooting Data (Historic)** ([HTML Report](./week5-nypd-rmd.html))
   - This report focuses on historical NYPD shooting data, analyzing patterns and trends across incidents.

## Prerequisites
To run the R scripts used for this analysis, you will need the following:
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended)
- Required R libraries: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `lubridate`

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   https://github.com/manjit28/covid-nypd-data-insights.git
2. Open the .Rmd files in RStudio or your preferred R environment.

3. Knit the files to generate reports in the format of your choice (HTML, PDF, etc.).
